# Bare Metal RPI GL Game Framework

This was created with the intention of allowing future students attempting this project to skip the stage of creating a graphics library and supporting detailed animations so they can jump into creating games immediately.

The Graphics library follows the following functions:

There is also a Map Generator module which supports procedural dungeon generation.

The game logic has been abstracted into a loop calling functions which you can use to modify the state of the program per frame.

Note: 
You should only need to modify the code in run.c
Keep in mind that this was created for the Raspberry Pi B 2011 model however, in order to get it to run on a newer model you would have to modify some of the '#define's in modules such as timer.c since the RPI timer may be in a different address in memory.

COMPILE SINGLE .c FILE INTO .elf FILE
arm-none-eabi-gcc -O2 -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -nostartfiles file.c -o kernel.elf

COMPILE MULTIPLE .s and .c FILES INTO .elf FILE
arm-none-eabi-gcc -O2 -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -nostartfiles *.s *.c -o kernel.elf
-- USE THIS IF THE ABOVE DOESN'T WORK
arm-none-eabi-gcc -O2 -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=soft -march=armv6zk -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -nostartfiles *.s *.c -o kernel.elf

CONVERT .elf into .img
arm-none-eabi-objcopy kernel.elf -O binary kernel.img
